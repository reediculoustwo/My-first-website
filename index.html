      <h2>About us</h2>
      <p>Reed’iculous Two was formed in 2023 after its members met at the Guildhall School of Music & Drama. United by a shared vision, the duo quickly discovered their common passion for creativity, humor, and breaking boundaries within classical music.</p>
      <p>Their mission is to promote double reed instruments, often overlooked in the wider musical world, and to challenge the idea that classical music belongs only to a select audience. By blending comedy with performance, Reed’iculous Two create concerts that are lively, approachable, and full of character.</p>
      <p>Beyond performing, they are dedicated educators, bringing music into schools through interactive workshops and concerts. They also provide mentoring for aspiring double reed players, sharing their expertise and inspiring the next generation of musicians.</p>
      <p>With an emphasis on fun, accessibility, and education, Reed’iculous Two prove that classical music can be both entertaining and inspiring for everyone.</p>
